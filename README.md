1.For the first app i have used client server architecture

Dataserver.java

* A TCP server that runs on port 9090.  When a client connects,
* it sends the client the current date and time, then closes the
 
* connection with that client.  Arguably just about the simplest
 
* server you can write.

Dataclient.java

* Runs the client as an application.  First it displays a dialog
     
* box asking for the IP address or hostname of a host running
     
* the date server, then connects to it and displays the date that
     
* it serves.

2.For the 2nd app i have used MVC pattern
